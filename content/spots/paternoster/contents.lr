The lifestyle here is very relaxed and laid-backed. Think long romantic walks on the beach and snuggling up with a book next to the fireplace rather than a night out clubbing. Thankfully there aren't any night clubs in Paternoster, cos that would just ruin the vibe, but there are some lovely restaurants. We recommend [Wolfgat](http://www.wolfgat.co.za/), [Gaaitjie](http://gaaitjie.co.za/) and Blikkie Pizzeria.
We stayed in a lovely, resonably priced B&B booked through [stayinpaternoster.co.za](https://www.stayinpaternoster.co.za/). If you're keen on glamping, be sure to check out [Sea Shack](http://www.seashack.co.za/).
P.S. the sea is freezing, bring a wetsuit!
